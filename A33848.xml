         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Was deſirous to make the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick a Preſent, without being at the ſame time oblig'd to make an Apology. The preſent Collection of Poems has afforded me an occaſion to perform it. They all carry ſuch Credentials, as not only to juſtifie the good Taſte of our Age and Nation, in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:106876:3"/> Approbation that has been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the greater part of them, but likewiſe to authorize their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Reception of all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. It is neither my Province, nor have I the Preſumption to ſhew, that the Performances of ſuch Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Hands, as this Collection is made up of, will ſtand the Teſt of the ſevereſt Criticiſms, and are work'd according to the Standard Rules of Poetry: but the beſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es I could adviſe with, have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd me they are ſo; and it is my Duty as well as Pride, to acquieſce in their Authority, and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. Nevertheleſs, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome ſmall overſights ſhall have been committed for want of a due
<pb facs="tcp:106876:3"/> Review: yet I muſt beg the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader to be pleas'd to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Richeſt Ore will have ſome Droſs; notwithſtanding which I deſpair not of ſo Honourable a Reception, as ſhall hereafter give Encouragement for a Second Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> have lately Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Five or Six Volumes of their choiceſt Poems, by ſeveral Hands; but I muſt beg, that this Collection may not be thought to be done in imitation of them. We are pretty well recovered from the Servile way of following their Modes; and this Publication is an effect of Emulation, to ſhew, That as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Genius and Language
<pb facs="tcp:106876:4"/> for the <hi>Drama</hi> and for <hi>Epich Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> has been granted, infinitely to excel theirs; ſo we have no leſs the Advantage in the leſs, tho' nice Productions of the Nature of theſe Collections. Their Gallantry and Courtſhip is what we juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn as Foppery; and their Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks are made up of nothing but Intolerable Dawbing: whereas in this Collection you will find Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the Sublimeſt Fancy, Govern'd by Solidity of Judgment, and Poliſh'd by the utmoſt Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Art; which ſufficiently demonſtrates, that our Great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, the <hi>Mecoenaſes</hi> of Poetry, can, when they pleaſe, be the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils</hi> and <hi>Horaces</hi> too.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106876:4"/>
            <p>I ſhall no longer detain the <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader,</hi> than to give him my Aſſurances that all Care and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence has been uſed as well by the Printer as my ſelf, to render this Impreſſion becoming ſuch finiſht Pieces from ſo Maſterly Hands.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE ART Of POETRY.</head>
            <p>I Have ſeldom known a Trick ſucceed, and will put none upon the Reader; But tell him plainly that I think it could never be more ſeaſonable than now to lay down ſuch Rules, as if they be obſerv'd, will make Men write more Correctly, and judge more diſcreetly; But <hi>Horace</hi> muſt be read ſeriouſly or not at all, for elſe the Reader wo'n't be the better for him, and I ſhall have loſt my labour. I have kept as cloſe as I could, both to the Meaniug, and the words of the Author, and done nothing but what I believe he would forgive if he were alive; And I have often ask'd my ſelf that Queſtion. I know this is a Field

               </q> But with all the reſpect due to the name of <hi>Ben. Johnſon,</hi> to which no Man pays more Veneration than I; it cannot be deny'd, that the conſtraint of Rhyme, and a literal Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation (to which <hi>Horace</hi> in this Book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf an Enemy) has made him want a Comment in many places.</p>
            <p>My chief care has been to Write intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and where the Latin was obſcure, I have added a Line or two to explain it.</p>
            <p>I am below the Envy of the Criticks, but if I durſt, I would beg them to remember, that <hi>Horace</hi> ow'd his Favour and his Fortune to the Character given of him by <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Varius,</hi> that <hi>Fundanius</hi> and <hi>Pollio</hi> are ſtill valued by what <hi>Horace</hi> ſays of them, and that in their Golden Age, there was a good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding among the Ingenious, and thoſe who were the moſt Eſteem'd were the beſt Natur'd.</p>

                  <l>A mighty Stag grew Monarch of the Heard,</l>
                  <l>By all his Savage Slaves obey'd, and fear'd:</l>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:106876:40"/>
                  <l>And while the Troops about their Soveraign fed,</l>

                  <l>He courts no choſen object, but compels:</l>
                  <l>No Subject his lov'd Miſtreſs dares deny,</l>
                  <l>But yields his hopes up to his Tyranny.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Long had this Prince imperiouſly thus ſway'd,</l>
                  <l>By no ſet Laws, but by his Will obey'd;</l>
                  <l>His fearful Slaves, to full Obedience grown,</l>
                  <l>Admire his ſtrength, and dare not uſe their own.</l>

                  <l>In the beſt Paſtures by his ſide he fed,</l>
                  <l>Arm'd with two large Militia's on his head:</l>
                  <l>As if he practis'd Majeſty, he walk't,</l>
                  <l>And at his Nod, he made not haſte, but ſtalk't.</l>

                  <l>By his large ſhade, he ſaw how great he was,</l>

                  <l>His thoughts as large as his proportion grew,</l>

                  <l>Love and Ambition growing with his ſtrength.</l>
                  <l>This hid Ambition his bold Paſſion ſhows,</l>

                  <l>One by Ambition urg'd, t'other Diſdain,</l>

                  <l>His antient Paſſions now began to move,</l>

                  <l>AS there is Muſick uninform'd by Art</l>
                  <l>In thoſe wild Notes, which with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heart</l>
                  <l>The Birds in unfrequented Shades expreſs,</l>
                  <l>Who better taught at home, yet pleaſe us leſs:</l>
                  <l>So in your Verſe, a native ſweetneſs dwells,</l>
                  <l>Which ſhames Compoſure, and its Art excells.</l>
                  <l>Singing, no more can your ſoft numbers grace,</l>
                  <l>Than Paint adds Charms unto a Beauteous Face.</l>

                  <l>Yet as when mighty Rivers gently creep,</l>
                  <l>Their even calmneſs does ſuppoſe them deep;</l>
                  <l>Such is your Muſe: No Metaphor ſwell'd high</l>
                  <l>With dangerous boldneſs lifts her to the Sky;</l>
                  <l>Thoſe mounting Fancies, when they fall again,</l>
                  <l>Shew Sand and Dirt at bottom do remain.</l>
                  <l>So firm a ſtrength, and yet withal ſo ſweet,</l>

                  <l>'Tis ſtrange each Line ſo great a weight ſhould bear,</l>

                  <l>And we, dull Souls, admire, but cannot ſee</l>

                  <l>Or 'tis ſome happineſs that ſtill purſues</l>
                  <l>Each Act and Motion of your Graceful Muſe.</l>

                  <l>Sure that's not all; this is a piece too fair</l>
                  <l>To be the Child of Chance, and not of Care.</l>
                  <l>No Atoms caſually together hurl'd</l>
                  <l>Could e'er produce ſo beautiful a World.</l>

                  <l>Men are more Deaf than Trees, more Wild than Seas:</l>

                  <l>Each Man who lives, of ſorrow hath his ſhare,</l>

                  <l>All who are happy, do their Merit boaſt,</l>
                  <l>Think Heaven ows'em more, and Heav'n is Juſt.</l>

                  <l>Oppreſs'd by numerous Vice, mangled and torn,</l>
                  <l>Wounded by Laughter, and by Wit forlorn.</l>
                  <l>I mean not here by Wit, what's truly ſo,</l>
                  <l>But that falſe Coin which does for Current go.</l>
                  <l>'Tis certain but a few can Judgment make</l>
                  <l>Of ſuch a gift, which but a few partake.</l>

                  <l>A generous ſcorn of Life for mean deſpair.</l>

                  <l>May be reſembled to the firſt Three Days,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>The Poets formerly did lie in wait</l>

                  <l>And learnt their Language but to ſteal their Wit.</l>
                  <l>He from that need his Country does redeem,</l>
